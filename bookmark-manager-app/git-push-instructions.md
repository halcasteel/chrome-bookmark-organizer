# Git Push Instructions

## Steps to push to GitHub:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name: `bookmark-manager-app`
   - Description: "AI-powered bookmark manager for @az1.ai team"
   - Keep it private if desired
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Add the remote repository** (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bookmark-manager-app.git
   ```

   Or if using SSH:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/bookmark-manager-app.git
   ```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Alternative: Push to existing repository

If you already have a repository:

```bash
# Set the remote
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>

# Push
git push -u origin main
```
