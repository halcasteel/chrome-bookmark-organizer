# Complete Integration Plan - TODO List
**Date**: 2025-06-19T19:35:00-04:00
**Total Tasks**: 50 (15 completed, 35 pending)

## Phase 1: Critical Configuration Fixes (BLOCKING - Do First)
Priority: **HIGH** - Nothing works until these are done

- [ ] Create database backup before major changes
- [ ] Fix database credentials consistency (use admin:admin everywhere)
- [ ] Update frontend .env.local to point to Rust backend (port 8000)
- [ ] Fix docker-compose.yml PostgreSQL port mapping to 5434:5432
- [ ] Fix docker-compose.yml Redis port mapping to 6382:6379
- [ ] Remove Node.js backend service from docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Remove file-watcher service from docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Fix database URLs in all Rust scripts (admin:admin@localhost:5434/bookmark_manager)

## Phase 2: Service Configuration Updates
Priority: **MEDIUM** - Needed for clean operation

- [ ] Update start-services.js to remove backend startup code (lines 430-496)
- [ ] Update start-services.js to remove workers startup code (lines 535-589)
- [ ] Create shared environment configuration file (.env.shared)
- [ ] Create unified startup script (start-all-services.sh)

## Phase 3: Core Functionality Testing
Priority: **HIGH** - Must verify basic operations work

- [ ] Test frontend connection to Rust API gateway
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test CRUD operations through Rust backend
- [ ] Test import functionality with Rust backend
- [ ] Check and update frontend API response format handling

## Phase 4: Data Integrity Verification
Priority: **MEDIUM** - Ensure no data loss

- [ ] Run schema comparison between Node.js and Rust databases
- [ ] Verify all users migrated correctly to Rust database
- [ ] Verify bookmark data integrity after migration

## Phase 5: AI-Ops Deployment
Priority: **MEDIUM** - Enhanced functionality

- [ ] Deploy AI-Ops monitoring agent
- [ ] Configure AI-Ops learning patterns
- [ ] Test AI-Ops integration with bookmark services
- [ ] Integrate with bookmark manager as proof of concept
- [ ] Deploy foundation agents and start learning

## Phase 6: Missing Features Implementation
Priority: **LOW** - Can be done after main integration

- [ ] Implement WebSocket support in Rust (or polling fallback)
- [ ] Implement 2FA in Rust backend
- [ ] Port A2A agents to Rust or create compatibility layer

## Phase 7: DevOps & Monitoring
Priority: **MEDIUM/LOW** - Production readiness

- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines for unified repository
- [ ] Perform security audit (JWT, CORS, authorization)
- [ ] Configure Rust service metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking for Rust services
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Benchmark Rust vs Node.js performance

## Phase 8: Final Cleanup
Priority: **LOW** - Housekeeping

- [ ] Archive deprecated Node.js backend directory
- [ ] Update all documentation references to remove Node.js
- [ ] Create final integration documentation

## Execution Timeline

### Day 1 (Today - Critical Path)
1. Phase 1: Configuration Fixes (2 hours)
2. Phase 2: Service Updates (1 hour)
3. Phase 3: Core Testing (2 hours)

### Day 2 (Integration Verification)
4. Phase 4: Data Verification (1 hour)
5. Phase 5: AI-Ops Deployment (3 hours)
6. Phase 7: Security & Monitoring Setup (2 hours)

### Week 2 (Enhancement & Cleanup)
7. Phase 6: Missing Features (8 hours)
8. Phase 8: Final Cleanup (2 hours)

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Frontend loads and connects to Rust API
- ✅ Users can log in and see their bookmarks
- ✅ Import functionality works
- ✅ Search returns results
- ✅ No errors in console or logs
- ✅ AI-Ops agents are monitoring
- ✅ All tests pass

## Risk Mitigation
- **Before starting**: Create full database backup
- **After each phase**: Test core functionality
- **If issues arise**: Have rollback plan ready
- **Document everything**: Keep notes of all changes

## Command Reference
```bash
# Quick validation commands
curl http://localhost:8000/health
psql -h localhost -p 5434 -U admin -d bookmark_manager -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
redis-cli -p 6382 ping
```
