## 🎯 Next Actions (Do These First!)

1. **Create database backup** before any changes
2. **Fix all configuration issues** in Phase 1
3. **Test basic connectivity** between frontend and Rust backend
4. **Verify authentication flow** works end-to-end
5. **Start AI-Ops monitor** and verify logging integration

---

## 💡 Quick Commands

```bash
# Start everything with new unified script
./scripts/services-manager.sh start

# Check system health
./scripts/services-manager.sh check

# View real-time logs
tail -f logs/unified.log

# Check AI-Ops status
curl http://localhost:8500/status | jq

# Run tests (when implemented)
cargo test --all
npm test
```

## 📝 Notes

- Vector logging system is fully implemented and ready
- AI-Ops Core is compiled and integrated with logging
- Two startup scripts available: `start-all-with-logging.sh` (simple) and `services-manager.sh` (full control)
- Frontend logging service is implemented but needs testing
- Database migration for application_logs table is ready
