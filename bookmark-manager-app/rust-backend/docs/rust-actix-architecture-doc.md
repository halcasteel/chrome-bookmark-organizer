## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### 1. API Gateway Layer

The gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests, implemented in Rust with Actix Web for maximum performance.

```rust
// Core Gateway Features
- Service Discovery (K8s API integration)
- Rate Limiting (Token bucket algorithm)
- Circuit Breaking (Hystrix pattern)
- Request Routing (Path-based and header-based)
- Authentication Middleware
- Compression & Caching
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Non-blocking I/O with Tokio runtime
- Zero-copy request forwarding
- Dynamic service discovery
- Graceful degradation

### 2. Core Microservices

Each service is a standalone Rust application optimized for its specific domain:

| Service | Purpose | Key Technologies |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Auth Service** | JWT authentication, 2FA, session management | Actix-web, jsonwebtoken, Redis |
| **Bookmarks Service** | CRUD operations, search, tagging | Actix-web, SQLx, tantivy |
| **Import Service** | HTML parsing, bookmark extraction | Actix-web, scraper, tokio |
| **Enrichment Service** | AI-powered tagging, summarization | Actix-web, reqwest, async-openai |
| **Task Service** | Async job orchestration, A2A system | Actix, NATS, state machines |

### 3. Data Architecture

```yaml
Primary Storage:
  PostgreSQL:
    - User data
    - Bookmarks metadata
    - Task states
    - Audit logs

Caching Layer:
  Redis:
    - Session storage
    - Rate limit counters
    - Hot data cache
    - Distributed locks

Object Storage:
  S3/MinIO:
    - HTML snapshots
    - Import files
    - Large attachments
```

### 4. Event-Driven Communication

NATS JetStream provides reliable, ordered event streaming:

```rust
Event Types:
├── BookmarkCreated
├── BookmarkUpdated
├── BookmarkDeleted
├── ImportCompleted
├── ValidationRequested
├── EnrichmentCompleted
└── TaskStatusChanged

Patterns:
├── Pub/Sub for notifications
├── Request/Reply for RPC
├── Queue Groups for load balancing
└── Durable consumers for reliability
```

## 🐳 Kubernetes Deployment Strategy

### Container Architecture

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for minimal images
FROM rust:1.75-alpine AS builder
# Build with musl for static linking
# Final image ~15MB

FROM alpine:3.19
# Run as non-root user
# Health checks included
```

### Deployment Patterns

1. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**
   - CPU/Memory based scaling
   - Custom metrics (RPS, queue depth)
   - Min 3 replicas for HA

2. **Service Mesh Integration (Istio)**
   - mTLS between services
   - Advanced traffic management
   - Canary deployments
   - Circuit breaking at mesh level

3. **Resource Management**
   ```yaml
   Resources:
     Requests:
       CPU: 100m-250m
       Memory: 128Mi-256Mi
     Limits:
       CPU: 500m-2000m
       Memory: 512Mi-2Gi
   ```

### StatefulSet for Data Stores

- PostgreSQL with persistent volumes
- Redis with AOF persistence
- Automated backup strategies
