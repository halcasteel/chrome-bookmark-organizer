## Phase 1: Bookmark Manager Integration (Week 1)

### Objectives
- Demonstrate AI-Ops Core capabilities
- Establish foundation for autonomous management
- Begin collecting operational knowledge

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Create Bookmark Monitor Agent
```rust
// Location: crates/ai-ops-core/src/agents/bookmark_monitor.rs
pub struct BookmarkMonitorAgent {
    // Monitor bookmark service health
    // Track import success rates  
    // Detect anomalies in user behavior
}
```

**Metrics to Track**:
- Bookmark creation rate
- Import job success/failure
- API response times
- Database query performance
- User activity patterns

#### 1.2 Implement Bookmark Diagnostic Agent
```rust
pub struct BookmarkDiagnosticAgent {
    // Analyze import failures
    // Diagnose performance issues
    // Identify error patterns
}
```

**Capabilities**:
- Parse import error logs
- Correlate failures with system state
- Identify root causes
- Suggest remediation steps

#### 1.3 Deploy Learning Agent
```rust
pub struct BookmarkLearningAgent {
    // Extract patterns from bookmark data
    // Learn optimal import strategies
    // Identify user preferences
}
```

**Learning Goals**:
- Common import failure patterns
- Optimal batch sizes for imports
- Peak usage patterns
- User categorization preferences

### Integration Points

1. **Backend Services**
   ```rust
   // In each Rust service, add event emission
   mesh.publish(Event {
       event_type: EventType::BookmarkCreated,
       payload: json!({ "user_id": user_id, "url": url }),
       // ...
   }).await?;
   ```

2. **Import Service**
   ```rust
   // Emit events for import lifecycle
   mesh.publish(Event {
       event_type: EventType::ImportStarted,
       payload: json!({ "source": "chrome", "count": 1000 }),
       // ...
   }).await?;
   ```

3. **Frontend Integration**
   ```javascript
   // Real-time agent status dashboard
   const AgentDashboard = () => {
       const [agents, setAgents] = useState([]);
       // WebSocket connection for live updates
   };
   ```

## Phase 2: Knowledge Acquisition (Week 2)

### Objectives
- Populate knowledge graph with real problems/solutions
- Train agents on actual operational data
- Establish baseline patterns

### Tasks

#### 2.1 Problem Capture
- Monitor all errors and exceptions
- Categorize by type and severity
- Create problem fingerprints
- Track occurrence patterns

#### 2.2 Solution Documentation
- Document manual interventions
- Capture successful resolutions
- Link solutions to problems
- Track success rates

#### 2.3 Pattern Extraction
- Identify recurring issues
- Extract common solutions
- Build pattern library
- Validate pattern accuracy

### Knowledge Seeding

```rust
// Seed common bookmark problems
let problems = vec![
    Problem {
        description: "Chrome import fails with large bookmarks file",
        category: "import",
        error_patterns: vec!["timeout", "memory limit"],
        // ...
    },
    Problem {
        description: "Duplicate bookmarks after import",
        category: "data-integrity",
        error_patterns: vec!["duplicate key", "constraint violation"],
        // ...
    },
];

for problem in problems {
    kg.add_problem(problem).await?;
}
```

## Phase 3: Autonomous Operations (Week 3)

### Objectives
- Enable self-healing capabilities
- Automate common resolutions
- Reduce manual intervention

### Tasks

#### 3.1 Auto-Remediation Rules
```rust
// Define remediation actions
let rules = vec![
    RemediationRule {
        pattern: "import_timeout",
        action: Action::RetryWithSmallerBatch,
        confidence_threshold: 0.8,
    },
    RemediationRule {
        pattern: "high_memory_usage",
        action: Action::RestartService,
        confidence_threshold: 0.9,
    },
];
```

#### 3.2 Healing Agent Activation
- Enable automatic problem resolution
- Set safety constraints
- Implement rollback mechanisms
- Add manual approval for critical actions

#### 3.3 Continuous Improvement
- Track remediation success
- Adjust confidence thresholds
- Evolve solution strategies
- Learn from failures

## Phase 4: Advanced Intelligence (Week 4)

### Objectives
- Predictive capabilities
- Cross-system learning
- Advanced pattern recognition

### Tasks

#### 4.1 Predictive Analytics
- Predict system failures before they occur
- Anticipate resource needs
- Forecast user behavior
- Preemptive scaling

#### 4.2 Multi-Agent Collaboration
```rust
// Implement advanced collaboration patterns
impl CollaborationProtocol {
    async fn consensus_decision(&self, agents: Vec<AgentId>, decision: Decision) -> Result<Consensus> {
        // Implement voting mechanism
        // Weight by agent expertise
        // Ensure quorum
    }
}
```

#### 4.3 Cross-Domain Learning
- Share knowledge between different services
- Apply bookmark patterns to other domains
- Build universal problem taxonomy
- Create reusable solution templates

## Deployment Strategy

### Infrastructure Requirements

1. **PostgreSQL Setup**
   ```sql
   -- Ensure pgvector extension
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
   
   -- Create dedicated schema
   CREATE SCHEMA ai_ops;
   
   -- Grant permissions
   GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA ai_ops TO bookmark_user;
   ```

2. **Redis Configuration**
   ```
   # Enable persistence
   appendonly yes
   appendfsync everysec
   
   # Set memory policy
   maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
   ```

3. **Agent Deployment**
   ```yaml
   # docker-compose.yml addition
