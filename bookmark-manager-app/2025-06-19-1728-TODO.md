# AI-Ops Core TODO List

**Generated**: 2025-06-19 17:28  
**Context**: AI-Ops Core Infrastructure Implementation

## 🎯 Current Focus: Deploy and Integrate

### High Priority - Immediate

1. **Run Full Test Suite** ⚡
   - Start PostgreSQL and Redis containers
   - Execute `cargo test -p ai-ops-core --all-features`
   - Fix any failing tests
   - Document test results

2. **Deploy Coordinator Service** ⚡
   - Build release binary: `cargo build -p ai-ops-core --release`
   - Create systemd service file or Docker container
   - Configure environment variables
   - Start coordinator and verify health

3. **Activate Foundation Agents** ⚡
   - Deploy Monitor Agent
   - Deploy Diagnostic Agent  
   - Deploy Learning Agent
   - Verify agent registration in service registry

### High Priority - This Week

4. **Bookmark Service Integration** 🔗
   - Add event emission to auth-service
   - Add event emission to bookmarks-service
   - Add event emission to import-service
   - Create bookmark-specific event types

5. **Knowledge Seeding** 🌱
   - Document 10 common bookmark problems
   - Create solutions for each problem
   - Add initial patterns (timeout, duplicate, validation)
   - Test solution retrieval

6. **Monitoring Dashboard** 📊
   - Create React component for agent status
   - WebSocket connection for real-time updates
   - Display active agents and health
   - Show recent events and solutions

### Medium Priority - Next Week

7. **Auto-Remediation Rules** 🤖
   - Define safe remediation actions
   - Set confidence thresholds
   - Implement approval workflow for critical actions
   - Test with simulated failures

8. **Performance Optimization** ⚡
   - Profile event processing latency
   - Optimize knowledge graph queries
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Load test with 1000+ events/second

9. **Production Deployment** 🚀
   - Create Kubernetes manifests
   - Set up Prometheus metrics
   - Configure Grafana dashboards
   - Implement gradual rollout

### Low Priority - Future

10. **Advanced Features** 🔮
    - Predictive failure detection
    - Cross-service pattern learning
    - Multi-agent consensus protocols
    - Self-modifying agent behaviors

11. **Platform Expansion** 🌍
    - Extract bookmark-agnostic components
    - Create plugin architecture
    - Build community pattern library
    - Open source preparation

## 📋 Completed Tasks Archive

### Infrastructure (✅ Complete)
- Created ai-ops-core crate structure
- Implemented universal agent trait system
- Built knowledge graph with pgvector
- Created event mesh with Redis Streams
- Fixed all compilation errors

### Development (✅ Complete)
- Developed foundation agents
- Built service registry
- Created AI interface layer
- Implemented pattern library
- Added comprehensive tests
- Created documentation and examples

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Week 1
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] 3+ agents deployed
- [ ] 100+ events processed
- [ ] 5+ problems documented
- [ ] Basic dashboard operational

### Week 2  
- [ ] 50+ problems in knowledge graph
- [ ] 20+ successful remediations
- [ ] <1 minute detection time
- [ ] 90% agent uptime

### Month 1
- [ ] 50% reduction in manual fixes
- [ ] 95% solution success rate
- [ ] Full Kubernetes deployment
- [ ] Production-ready monitoring

## 🚨 Blockers & Risks

1. **Test Database Setup**: Need test database for integration tests
2. **Redis Persistence**: Ensure Redis configured for durability
3. **Resource Usage**: Monitor agent memory/CPU consumption
4. **Security**: Implement proper auth for agent actions

## 📝 Notes

- All database connections use: `postgres://admin:admin@localhost:5434/bookmark_manager`
- Redis connection: `redis://localhost:6382`
- Rust binaries in: `target/release/`
- Examples demonstrate core functionality

**Next Action**: Run the test suite to ensure everything works before deployment.
