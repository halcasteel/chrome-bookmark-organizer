# CHECKPOINT - Project Status as of June 15, 2025

## üö® Current State: Non-Functional Application

The application is currently **NOT WORKING** due to authentication issues. While significant infrastructure improvements have been made, users cannot log in to use the application.

## How to Start the Application

**USE ONLY THIS COMMAND:**
```bash
node start-services.js
```

This unified startup script is the **ONLY** supported way to run the application. It provides:
- Automatic Docker container management
- Health checks for all services  
- Database migration execution
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Unified logging to `logs/` directory
- Proper service dependency management

## Recent Accomplishments (June 2025)

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Improvements
1. **Unified Logging System**
   - Implemented comprehensive logging across entire stack
   - Created `unifiedLogger.js` service for backend
   - Added frontend logger that sends to backend
   - Built real-time log viewer UI component
   - All logs stream to `logs/` with rotation

2. **Robust Startup Script**
   - Created `start-services.js` with health checks
   - Colored output and progress bars
   - Graceful error handling
   - Service dependency management
   - Automatic retry logic

3. **Environment Consolidation**
   - Merged multiple .env files into single source
   - Fixed port conflicts (PostgreSQL: 5434, Redis: 6382)
   - Standardized configuration across services

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Archived 74+ non-essential files
   - Cleaned up directory structure
   - Performed comprehensive dependency analysis
   - Reduced to 127 essential files

### ‚ùå Known Issues
1. **Authentication Broken**
   - Users cannot log in
   - JWT token generation/validation issues suspected
   - 2FA verification may be misconfigured

2. **Frontend-Backend Communication**
   - Some API calls may fail
   - WebSocket connections might not establish
   - CORS configuration needs verification

## Technical Details

### Service Configuration
```
Frontend:    http://localhost:5173
Backend API: http://localhost:3001
PostgreSQL:  localhost:5434 (non-standard port)
Redis:       localhost:6382 (non-standard port)
Log Viewer:  http://localhost:5173/logs
```

### Database Status
- PostgreSQL running with pgvector extension
- All migrations executed successfully
- Schema includes users, bookmarks, collections, tags tables
- Async import tracking tables present

### File Organization
```
Total files: 204 ‚Üí 127 (after cleanup)
Archived: 74 files + 23,900 bookmark validation JSONs
Essential: 127 production files
```

## Next Steps Priority

### üî¥ Critical (Must Fix First)
1. **Fix Authentication**
   - Debug JWT token generation
   - Verify auth middleware
   - Test login endpoint
   - Check 2FA implementation

2. **Verify API Connectivity**
   - Test all API endpoints
   - Fix CORS issues
   - Ensure frontend can reach backend

### üü° Important (After Auth Works)
3. **Test Core Features**
   - Bookmark import functionality
   - AI classification
   - Search capabilities
   - Collection management

4. **WebSocket Functionality**
   - Real-time import progress
   - Live log streaming
   - Notification system

### üü¢ Nice to Have
5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching strategies
   - Query optimization
   - Frontend bundle size

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start everything (REQUIRED)
node start-services.js

# Monitor logs
tail -f logs/unified.log
tail -f logs/errors.log

# Check health
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# View logs in browser
http://localhost:5173/logs

# Database access
docker exec -it bookmark-postgres psql -U admin -d bookmark_manager

# Redis CLI
docker exec -it bookmark-redis redis-cli
```

## Log Files
- `logs/unified.log` - All application logs
- `logs/errors.log` - Error-level events only
- `logs/services.log` - Service health/status
- `logs/backend.log` - Backend stdout/stderr
- `logs/frontend.log` - Frontend build output

## Environment Variables (.env)
```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://admin:admin@localhost:5434/bookmark_manager
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6382
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
ENABLE_2FA=true
LOG_LEVEL=info
UNIFIED_LOGGING=true
```

## Summary

While the infrastructure is now solid with unified logging and a robust startup system, the application remains non-functional due to authentication issues. The immediate priority is fixing the login system so that the extensive features can be accessed and tested.
