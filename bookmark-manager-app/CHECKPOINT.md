# CHECKPOINT - Bookmark Manager Development Status

## Date: June 15, 2025

### Current State Summary
The bookmark manager application has undergone significant refactoring to improve code quality, logging, and maintainability. While the infrastructure is more robust, the application is currently non-functional due to authentication issues.

## ðŸš¨ How to Start the Application

**USE ONLY THIS COMMAND:**
```bash
node start-services.js
```

This unified startup script is the **ONLY** supported way to run the application. It provides:
- Automatic Docker container management (PostgreSQL & Redis)
- Health checks for all services with retry logic
- Database migration execution
- Real-time progress monitoring with colored output
- Unified logging to `logs/` directory
- Proper service dependency management

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. **Comprehensive Logging Infrastructure**
- Implemented unified logging system using Winston across 30+ files
- Fixed all import path errors for unifiedLogger
- Fixed Winston EPIPE error that was crashing backend
- Added structured logging with service/method context
- Created real-time log viewer component
- Set up log rotation and multiple output targets:
  - `logs/error.log` - Error events only
  - `logs/combined.log` - All log events  
  - `logs/http.log` - HTTP request logs
- Added comprehensive error logging in all try-catch blocks

### 2. **Unified Startup Script**
- Created `start-services.js` - a comprehensive startup script
- Provides real-time progress monitoring with colored output
- Handles Docker container management for PostgreSQL and Redis
- Includes health checks and automatic retries
- Streams logs to both console and files

### 3. **Environment Consolidation**
- Merged multiple .env files into a single configuration
- Standardized environment variable usage across the codebase
- Fixed port conflicts (Redis: 6382, PostgreSQL: 5434)

### 4. **Project Cleanup**
- Conducted comprehensive dependency analysis
- Archived 74+ non-essential files to `_archive/`
- Reduced codebase to 127 essential files
- Created organized archive structure

## Known Issues

### 1. **Authentication Broken** ðŸ”´
- Users cannot log in properly
- Login succeeds but subsequent API calls fail
- JWT verification may have issues
- Frontend shows "WebSocket disconnected" after login
- Admin credentials exist: admin@az1.ai / changeme123

### 2. **WebSocket Connectivity** ðŸ”´
- WebSocket connections failing
- Shows as disconnected in frontend
- May have CORS issues
- Port configuration verified (using default 3001)

### 3. **API Endpoints** ðŸŸ¡
- Some endpoints returning 404
- CORS configuration includes ports 5173, 5174
- Auth middleware may be blocking requests

## Technical Configuration

### Services and Ports
```
Frontend:    http://localhost:5173
Backend API: http://localhost:3001
PostgreSQL:  localhost:5434 (non-standard)
Redis:       localhost:6382 (non-standard)
WebSocket:   ws://localhost:3001
Log Viewer:  http://localhost:5173/logs (admin only)
```

### Key Dependencies
- Node.js: 20.17.0+
- PostgreSQL: 15+ with pgvector
- Redis: Latest
- React: 18 (TypeScript strict mode)
- Express: 4 (ES6 modules)
- Winston: 3.x (unified logger)
- Socket.io: 4.x (WebSocket)
- Bull: Latest (job queues)

## Recent Fixes (Last Session)

### Import Path Corrections
- Fixed 18 files with incorrect unifiedLogger imports
- Services now use `./unifiedLogger.js`
- Other modules use `../services/unifiedLogger.js`
- Removed duplicate imports

### Logger Usage Updates
- Replaced all `logInfo` and `logError` calls
- Updated to use `unifiedLogger.info()` and `unifiedLogger.error()`
- Added proper error context with stack traces

### Database Connection
- Fixed environment loading in db/index.js
- Proper path resolution for .env file
- Connection string correctly uses port 5434

## File Structure

â””â”€â”€ .env                   # Unified configuration
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Always use the startup script**: `node start-services.js`
2. **Check logs first**: `tail -f logs/combined.log`
3. **Use unified logger**: Never use console.log
4. **Include context**: Always add service and method in logs
5. **Test incrementally**: Fix auth before moving to features
6. **Monitor errors**: `tail -f logs/error.log`

## Logging Standards

```javascript
// Correct usage:
unifiedLogger.info('Operation description', {
  service: 'serviceName',
  method: 'methodName',
  userId: user.id,
  // other context
});

// Error logging:
unifiedLogger.error('Error description', {
  service: 'serviceName',
  method: 'methodName',
  error: error.message,
  stack: error.stack,
  // other context
});
```

## Next Steps Priority

### ðŸ”´ Critical (Must Fix First)
1. **Fix Authentication Flow**
   - Debug why login succeeds but subsequent calls fail
   - Check JWT token in localStorage
   - Verify auth middleware is properly attached
   - Test with direct API calls (curl/Postman)

2. **Fix WebSocket Connection**
   - Debug Socket.io handshake
   - Check CORS settings for WebSocket
   - Verify WebSocket service initialization
   - Test with WebSocket client tools

### ðŸŸ¡ Important (After Auth Works)
3. **API Connectivity**
   - List all registered routes
   - Test each endpoint individually
   - Fix any missing route handlers
   - Verify middleware order

4. **Core Feature Testing**
   - Test bookmark import with large files
   - Validate AI classification
   - Test search functionality
   - Verify async job processing

### ðŸŸ¢ Nice to Have
5. **Performance & UX**
   - Add loading states
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Add retry logic for failed requests
   - Optimize bundle size

## Critical Information

- **Admin Credentials**: admin@az1.ai / changeme123
- **Database**: bookmark_manager on port 5434
- **Redis**: Port 6382 (non-standard)
- **JWT Secret**: In .env file (local-dev-jwt-secret-change-in-production)
- **2FA**: Enabled by default
- **CORS Origins**: http://localhost:5173, http://localhost:5174
- **Log Level**: info (can be changed in .env)

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Users can register and log in
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
- [ ] WebSocket connections establish successfully
- [ ] 2FA setup and verification works
- [ ] Bookmarks can be imported
- [ ] Search returns results
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket
- [ ] All API endpoints respond correctly
- [x] Unified logging works across all services
- [x] No import path errors
- [x] Services start without crashes
- [x] Database connections work properly

## Time Investment
- Initial setup and analysis: 4 hours
- Unified logging implementation: 5 hours
- Import path fixes: 1 hour
- Project cleanup: 2 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour
- **Total**: ~13 hours

---

**Note**: This checkpoint represents significant infrastructure improvements with comprehensive logging now in place. The immediate focus must be on restoring authentication functionality and debugging the WebSocket connection issues. With the logging system complete, debugging should be much easier.
