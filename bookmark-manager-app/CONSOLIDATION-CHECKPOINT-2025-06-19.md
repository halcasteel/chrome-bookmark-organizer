# Rust Backend Consolidation Checkpoint
**Date**: 2025-06-19T19:10:00-04:00
**Action**: Consolidated Rust backend into main project repository

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Symlink
- Deleted `rust-migration` symlink that pointed to `/home/halcasteel/RUST-ACTIX-MIGRATION`
- This eliminates confusion and complexity

### 2. Copied Rust Project
- Copied entire Rust project to `rust-backend/` directory
- Removed `.git` and `.github` directories to avoid nested repositories
- Cleaned up temporary files (tokens, logs, old checkpoints)

### 3. Updated Documentation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated all references from `rust-migration/` to `rust-backend/`
- **README.md**: Updated project structure and commands
- **.gitignore**: Added Rust-specific ignore patterns

### 4. Repository Status
- Main repository: https://github.com/halcasteel/chrome-bookmark-organizer.git
- Previous Rust repo: https://github.com/AZ1-ai/bookmark-manager (now obsolete)

## Benefits of Consolidation

1. **Simplified Development**
   - Single repository for entire application
   - No symlink confusion
   - Easier to navigate and understand

2. **Better CI/CD**
   - Single deployment pipeline
   - Unified testing strategy
   - Simpler GitHub Actions

3. **AI-Ops Integration**
   - All code in one place for monitoring
   - Unified event stream
   - Complete visibility

4. **Easier Collaboration**
   - One repository to clone
   - Consistent development environment
   - Simplified setup instructions

## Next Steps

1. **Archive Old Repository**
   - Add deprecation notice to https://github.com/AZ1-ai/bookmark-manager
   - Point to main repository

2. **Update CI/CD**
   - Create unified GitHub Actions workflow
   - Include both frontend and Rust backend tests

3. **Complete Integration**
   - Frontend API integration with Rust backend
   - Remove deprecated Node.js backend
   - Full end-to-end testing
