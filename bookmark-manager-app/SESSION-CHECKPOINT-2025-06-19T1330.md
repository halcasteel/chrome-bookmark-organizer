# Session Checkpoint Before Compact
**Timestamp**: 2025-06-19T13:30:00-04:00

## ðŸŽ¯ Session Summary

### What We Discovered
1. **Rust Backend HAS Multi-Agent Async with Redis**
   - Full A2A implementation in `crates/a2a/`
   - Redis queue service with priority queues
   - Agent system implemented (Import, Validation, Enrichment, etc.)
   - Bull-compatible for Node.js interop

2. **Created Key Files**
   - `start-services.py` - Python startup script
   - `start-services.zsh` - Zsh startup script
   - `rustApi.ts` - Frontend API adapter
   - Integration test files
   - Updated `.env` for Rust backend

### Current Status
- About to begin systematic analysis using SAREEEI methodology
- Created detailed analysis plan
- Ready to verify actual implementation vs documentation

### Next Actions (After Compact)
1. Execute Backend Service Analysis following the plan
2. Test each service with actual API calls
3. Document what's working vs what needs fixes
4. Fix issues iteratively
5. Achieve 100% working system

### Key Insight
The documentation saying "Redis integration stubbed but not connected" appears to be WRONG. The code shows full Redis implementation with:
- QueueService in `crates/a2a/src/queue.rs`
- Task queues defined
- Bull compatibility
- Agent queue consumers

We need to TEST to verify it's actually working!
