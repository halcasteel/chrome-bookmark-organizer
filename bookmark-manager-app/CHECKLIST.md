## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Commands

```bash
# Start application (REQUIRED METHOD)
node start-services.js

# View logs
tail -f logs/unified.log

# Check specific service
docker ps | grep bookmark

# Test auth endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"testpass"}'

# Access database
docker exec -it bookmark-postgres psql -U admin -d bookmark_manager

# Clear Redis cache
docker exec -it bookmark-redis redis-cli FLUSHALL
```

## Notes

- Always use `start-services.js` to run the application
- Check logs first when debugging any issue
- The app is currently non-functional due to auth issues
- Port numbers: PostgreSQL (5434), Redis (6382)
- All async operations use Bull queues
- WebSocket is used for real-time updates
