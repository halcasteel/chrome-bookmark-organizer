# CHECKLIST - Bookmark Manager Development Tasks

## üö® How to Run the Application

**ALWAYS use this command to start:**
```bash
node start-services.js
```

This is the **ONLY** supported way to run the application. It manages all services, health checks, and logging.

## üî¥ Critical Issues (Blocking Everything)

### Authentication System
- [ ] Debug why login is failing
- [ ] Check JWT token generation in auth routes
- [ ] Verify auth middleware is working
- [ ] Test `/api/auth/login` endpoint directly
- [ ] Fix password hashing/comparison
- [ ] Ensure tokens are being stored in frontend
- [ ] Verify token is sent in API headers
- [ ] Check CORS configuration for credentials

### 2FA Implementation
- [ ] Verify TOTP secret generation
- [ ] Test QR code generation
- [ ] Fix 2FA verification endpoint
- [ ] Ensure recovery codes work
- [ ] Test 2FA disable/re-enable flow

## üü° High Priority (After Auth Works)

### Core Functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Commands

```bash
# Start application (REQUIRED METHOD)
node start-services.js

# View logs
tail -f logs/unified.log

# Check specific service
docker ps | grep bookmark

# Test auth endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"testpass"}'

# Access database
docker exec -it bookmark-postgres psql -U admin -d bookmark_manager

# Clear Redis cache
docker exec -it bookmark-redis redis-cli FLUSHALL
```

## Notes

- Always use `start-services.js` to run the application
- Check logs first when debugging any issue
- The app is currently non-functional due to auth issues
- Port numbers: PostgreSQL (5434), Redis (6382)
- All async operations use Bull queues
- WebSocket is used for real-time updates
