    "description": "VCs operate on the golden rule: Whoever has the gold, makes the rules.\n\n“But Shuaaaannnnn, their whole business is to fund founders like me! They should cater to what I need!”\n\nCute, but no.\n\nThe other day, I posted about why the CEO should always be the one pitching, not Steve from UpWork.\n\nIt seemed to hit a nerve because I got a lot of responses.\n\nMany founders think that the VC partner or decision maker should be the one meeting with them and not the junior associate.\n\nSorry, but you’re not in a position to dictate terms.\n\nWhen you meet with VCs, it’s essentially a sales call. \n\nYou’re pitching your company and hoping to secure funding. \n\nYou don’t get to choose who’s sitting across the table.\n\nGeneral partners are usually busy meeting with their portfolio companies, posting on social media, or playing pickleball.\n\nThat’s just the way it is.\n\nAnd if you think that’s bad, just wait until you see how long it takes them to decide to invest.\n\nOr not invest.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause most firms only make a few investments a year while getting thousands of decks.\n\nSo if you actually manage to get a meeting, consider it a win. \n\nUse it to build a relationship, show off your startup, and prove you’re worth investing in.\n\nDon’t demand to see the boss because you think your AI for sub sandwiches is worthy of a million-dollar investment.\n\nRemember, you’re not pitching just an idea. \n\nYou’re pitching you. \n\nAnd if you come off as entitled, you’ll be back on UpWork pitching Steve for a second round of edits.\n\n#startup #founders  #venturecapital\n | 20 comments on LinkedIn",
