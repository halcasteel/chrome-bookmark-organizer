    "description": "<p>In February 2020 PMI published <a href=\"https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pmi-pulse-2020-final.pdf?v=2a5fedd3-671a-44e1-9582-c31001b37b61&amp;sc_lang_temp=en\">PMI Pulse of the Profession</a> that says: &#8220;Work has changed. So must the way the world thinks about projects.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We continuously need to improve our ways of working and develop our skills, but 2020 gave us a harsh lesson that we also need to be somewhat agile. According to PMI, to be successful in the future, our organizations need to be agile, but also focus on the right technology and secure relevant skills. You can read further:</p>\n<blockquote><ins style=\"text-decoration: none;\" cite=\"https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/forging-future-focused-culture-11908)\">\n<p>&#8220;For the first time for Pulse, executive leaders identified which factors they see as the most important to achieve success in the future. The top three were: organisational agility (35 per cent), choosing the right technologies to invest in (32 per cent) and securing relevant skills (31 per cent).&#8221;&#160;</p>\n</ins></blockquote>\n<p>So let's focus on how the organization can ensure agility in the management process for software delivery.</p>",
