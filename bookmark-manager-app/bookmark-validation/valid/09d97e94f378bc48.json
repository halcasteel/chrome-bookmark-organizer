    "description": "\n     Disclosed is a building panel curved along the major and minor axes which can be manufactured from a plurality of strips of building material each having the same geometric shape. A mold is provided upon which a first layer of geometrically identical strips is temporarily fastened. In a preferred embodiment, at least a second layer of strips is provided over the first layer and bonded thereto by an epoxy adhesive. Because all of the strips have the same geometric shape and can be mass produced and a compound or complex curvature panel can be made at extremely low cost. Additionally, disclosed is the application of such a compound or complex curved panel to the housing and in the preferred embodiment, boat building fields. Additionally disclosed is the method of applying such a panel to the building of a boat hull. \n   \n   ",
