      "title": "The Product Growth Model - The North Star for All Growth Efforts Practicalities of building impactful growth functions. Why a Product Growth Model should guide all growth initiatives across teams. The five growth motions from no-touch PLG to dedicated-touch account-based sales that drive business success. Why your growth team's success depends on company-wide alignment rather than isolated efforts. The Product Growth Model - The North Star for All Growth Efforts A growth team is tasked with optimising one or more aspects of growth related to their product. At the highest level, in any Product Growth Model, there are four growth levers: Acquisition, Retention, Monetisation and Expansion. Every business needs to be able to answer the following questions: How do we Acquire users/teams? How do we Monetise users/teams? How do we Retain users/teams? How do we Expand usage? Put more simply, how do we grow? With answers to these questions, a company can construct a set of planning assumptions and combine them into an overall picture of the company’s trajectory. This results in what we refer to as a Product Growth Model. The Product Growth Model is the North Star for all growth initiatives. Are Expansion initiatives delivering the expected results? Is the new customer Acquisition engine performing better or worse than the assumptions in the Product Growth Model? Do we need to make adjustments in targeting – given Renewals are underperforming expectations? Within each of the domains above, a business will have primary (and sometimes secondary) growth motions including: No-touch (product-led growth, or PLG) Low-touch (product-led sales, or PLS) Medium-touch (inbound marketing-led, “Inbound”) High-touch (outbound sales-led, “Outbound”) Dedicated-touch (account-based sales, or ABS) When users realise Impact from a product, it’s unsurprising that most companies’ primary motion for retaining users and teams is product-led. Many businesses also either have—or aspire to have—product-led motions for Acquisition, Monetisation and/or Expansion. The Product Growth Model ultimately describes and quantifies how a product grows. A founder or first Growth hire might create the initial iteration, but over time, growth teams typically own the Product Growth Model. They ensure it is kept up to date with feedback that incorporates the observed performance of Growth Loops, learnings from the growth team, evolution of the product, and shifts in company strategy or the wider market. The growth team uses the Product Growth Model to plan and execute the strategic opportunities on which they focus. Ultimately, the Product Growth Model should inform plans not only for the growth team, but for teams across the company: R&D, Marketing, Customer Success and beyond. Without this dedicated team, there is often no ownership of the Product Growth Model–or worse, the Product Growth Model isn’t created or quantified at all. This can lead to prioritisation decisions being made without strategic input. Inevitably, competing priorities such as building feature X to help close the next big deal can mean important product growth initiatives are inadequately funded, under-resourced, or passed over entirely. ➡ ️ Anti-pattern: You may find your organisation defaulting to the belief that PLG is the sole responsibility of this single team. As a result, others in the organisation might assume PLG is not their concern. This should be a red flag. For PLG to work, it must be a central concern for everyone–even those not directly assigned to a growth team. Standout PLG companies have growth built into their DNA. Product teams prioritise capability development based on whether the resulting motion supports the overall Product Growth Model, and whether it fuels or inhibits micro and macro Growth Loops. The criteria for judging the initial and ongoing success of new features can include relevant growth metrics at the feature level and at the product level. When that is the case, having a growth team can be an additional superpower, as the growth team can focus on: Core constraints w",
